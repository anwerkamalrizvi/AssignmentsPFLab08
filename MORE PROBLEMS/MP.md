1. Write a C program that takes a square matrix as input and prints its diagonal elements.
2. Write a C program that generates a sequence of prime numbers within a given range using
nested loops.
3. Generate a pattern of odd numbers in decreasing order starting from a user-specified number
using nested loops.
4. Implement a C program to find the transpose of a given m x n matrix. Print the transposed
matrix.
5. Write a C program to find the saddle point(s) in a given 3x3 matrix. A saddle point is an element
that is the smallest in its row and the largest in its column.
6. Write a C program that finds the maximum element in a given m x n matrix and its position (row,
column).
7. Write a C program to multiply two matrices of size 3x3 and display the result matrix.
8. Write a C program to generate a diamond shape pattern using nested loops. The program
should take the number of rows for the upper half of the diamond as input from the user.<br>
